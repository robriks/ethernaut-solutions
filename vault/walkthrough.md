# Ethernaut Walkthrough: Vault
## Welcome to KweenBirb's 9th installment of Ethernaut walkthroughs! 

Ethernaut is a set of gamified Solidity challenges in the style of a CTF, where each level features a hackable smart contract that will inform you of various known security vulnerabilities on EVM blockchains.

This repo will walk you through a solution to Vault.sol, the 9th challenge in the series. You can find the challenge itself and fully fleshed out solution in the .txt file in the root directory and .sol file in this directory. Let's begin!

In this challenge, Ethernaut provides us with only one sentence: 'Unlock the vault to pass the level!'
