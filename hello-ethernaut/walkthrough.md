## Welcome to KweenBirb's 1st installment of Ethernaut walkthroughs! 

Ethernaut is a set of gamified Solidity challenges in the style of a CTF, where each level features a hackable smart contract that will inform you of various known security vulnerabilities on EVM blockchains.

What are you doing here?! Ethernaut walks you through everything you need to complete the 1st challenge on the Ethernaut page itself! I promise you, it's very quick and easy to complete- just be sure to connect to the correct testnet and obtain the test Ether you need to pay for gas on any transactions you submit. As mentioned, all those steps are outlined in detail at ethernaut.openzeppelin.com

I'll see you at the next level!
