# Ethernaut Walkthroughs
## Welcome to KweenBirb's repository of Ethernaut walkthroughs! 

Created by OpenZeppelin to bolster security knowledge across the Web3 space, Ethernaut is a set of gamified Solidity challenges in the style of a CTF, where each level features a hackable smart contract that will inform you of various known security vulnerabilities on EVM blockchains.

This repo contains solutions and walkthroughs for all 29 challenges in the series. Each folder in this repo's root directory contains the challenge itself in a .txt file, its fully fleshed out solution in Solution.sol, and a verbal walkthrough in the walkthrough.md file. Some of the directory structures vary as different solutions require use of differing smart contract tooling frameworks, including Foundry, Hardhat, and Remix.
